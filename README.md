# 🌳 Decision Tree Classification Demo

A hands-on demo of **Decision Tree classification** with **pre-pruning** and **post-pruning** techniques to prevent overfitting and boost model reliability.

## 🚀 Features
- Pre-Pruning (Early Stopping) ✅
- Post-Pruning (Cost Complexity Pruning) ✂️
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV ⚙️
- Performance evaluation with Accuracy Score & Classification Report 📊

## 💻 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-classification.git

⚖️ Key Takeaway

Pruning keeps models efficient, reliable & generalizable across datasets.
